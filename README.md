# SACO_BA_Case_Study
Business Analysis case study for SACO IT SME - BA Intern application
---1. Overview
This project is a case study for a Business Analyst (BA) internship at VNG. It analyzes the information systems of SACO, a small IT SME in Ho Chi Minh City, using SWOT analysis to identify gaps and proposes two solutions (Zoho One and Microsoft Integration) to drive digital transformation, reduce costs, and enhance scalability.

---2. Objectives
Analyze SACO’s systems (CRM, ERP, AIS, HRM, TPS, MIS) to identify strengths and weaknesses.
Propose solutions to optimize operations, improve security, and support market expansion.
Recommend Zoho One as the optimal choice for SACO’s SME needs.

---3. Key Findings
SWOT Insights: SACO’s self-developed systems are flexible but costly (50-87M VND/year maintenance) and lack scalability.
Zoho One: Comprehensive, AI-supported, reduces costs by 30-50% (~167-250M VND/year).
Microsoft Integration: Cost-effective but complex, less scalable.
Impact: Zoho One enables 20% revenue growth via market expansion.
